## Fullstack Academy

I completed the Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Fullstack Academy, an intensive, hands-on program covering both defensive and offensive security. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on projects that showcased my skills in areas such as threat detection, penetration testing, firewall configuration, and incident response. I gained experience with industry-standard tools including Splunk, Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit, while building a strong foundation in security fundamentals and real-world problem solving.

Attached in the Career Simulations folder are projects that were reviewed and approved by cybersecurity professionals that I completed during my time at Fullstack Academy. It showcases my skills and capabilities as a cybersecurity professional.
