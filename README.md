# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Hello, I’m Eric Liu.
I’m an aspiring cybersecurity analyst and enthusiast with hands-on experience in network security, incident response, firewall configuration, and vulnerability assessment. I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, turning them into clear, actionable solutions, and sharing my findings through writeups and projects. Passionate about protecting systems and data, I thrive on practical labs and hands-on security work that strengthen both skills and knowledge.

## Fullstack Academy

I completed the Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Fullstack Academy, an intensive, hands-on program covering both defensive and offensive security. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on projects that showcased my skills in areas such as threat detection, penetration testing, firewall configuration, and incident response. I gained experience with industry-standard tools including Splunk, Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit, while building a strong foundation in security fundamentals and real-world problem solving.

## KC7-Cyber
This repository showcases my work with KC7, a free cyber defense simulation platform. Here, I document completed challenges, break down investigative scripts, and share insights gained while analyzing real-world security scenarios. My goal is to demonstrate practical skills in log analysis, threat detection, and incident response, while building a resource that reflects both my learning process and problem-solving approach.

## PicoCTF
PicoCTF is an online cybersecurity platform where I complete interactive CTF challenges in areas like cryptography, web exploitation, forensics, and binary analysis. For each challenge, I solve the problem, document my methodology, and create detailed writeups to showcase my technical approach and learning. The following write ups are specifically for the Forensics Category. Here is a [link](https://play.picoctf.org/users/Ecliu) to my picoCTF profile.
